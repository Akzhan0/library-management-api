# Application Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

- Controller layer handles HTTP requests
- Service layer contains business logic
- Repository layer handles database access
- DTOs are used for data transfer
- Exception layer provides centralized error handling

This architecture improves maintainability and separation of concerns.
